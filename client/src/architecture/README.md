# EveryPoll React Architecture

This directory contains the architectural documentation for the EveryPoll application frontend. The documentation outlines the component structure, state management strategy, data flow, and routing structure.

## Documentation Files

- `ComponentHierarchy.md`: Outlines the component organization and parent-child relationships
- `CoreComponents.md`: Detailed descriptions of the main components
- `StateManagement.md`: Strategy for managing application state
- `DataFlow.md`: How data flows through the application
- `RoutingStructure.md`: Application routes and corresponding components

This architecture serves as a blueprint for implementation and should be referenced during development to maintain consistency in the codebase.
