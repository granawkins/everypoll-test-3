# EveryPoll Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the steps needed to transform the JavaScript template into the EveryPoll application - a social network for polls where users can create, vote on, and cross-reference polls.

## 1. Project Setup & Initial Configuration

- [x] Define database schema for polls, users, and votes
- [x] Setup required packages and dependencies
- [ ] Install and configure frontend dependencies
  - Material-UI for component library
  - React Query for data fetching
  - React Hook Form for form handling
  - Recharts for visualizations
  - Redux Toolkit for global state management
- [ ] Install and configure backend dependencies
  - Express middleware (session, cookie-parser, etc.)
  - Zod for API validation
  - Required security packages

## 2. Backend Development - Authentication

- [ ] Complete Google OAuth integration
  - Finish Passport.js configuration
  - Create login/logout routes
  - Implement session handling
- [ ] Add authentication middleware for protected routes
- [ ] Create user API endpoints (profile, settings)

  - PUT /api/polls/:id (update)
  - DELETE /api/polls/:id
- [ ] Create API endpoints for votes
  - POST /api/polls/:id/vote
  - GET /api/polls/:id/results
- [ ] Implement poll cross-referencing
  - POST /api/polls/:id/references
  - GET /api/polls/:id/references
  - GET /api/polls/:id/results/cross/:refId/:optionId
- [ ] Add validation with Zod

## 4. Frontend - Core Components
